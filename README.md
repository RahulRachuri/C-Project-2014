The Idea
We built a modified version of Battleship and Blackjack in C.
There will be a menu which takes the user input and opens the game that he wants to play.
Battleship
==============
This game will feature a one player and a two player option which the user selects in the beginning from a menu printed to him.
The way Battleship works is player one has 4 ships of different lengths to place on a board of length n and breadth n units. Player one inputs the coordinates of the place where he wants to put his ship one by one. After player one locks in the positions of his ships the computer prompts player two for the positions of their ships(if there is a player two).
The grid will be reprinted after every turn and will make use of three different symbols - one to represent the points that haven’t been guessed by the player/computer, one to represent the ones that have been guessed and are a miss and one to represent the points that are a hit.
Also the result of every move by the user will be printed along with the grid.
￼
Blackjack
==============
This game is played against the computer. The computer and the player will be given 2 cards in the beginning.
The aim is to get the sum of the values of the cards as close to 21 as possible.
The player will have two options at every turn, Hit or Fold.
If he selects Hit he will be given another card, he is busted if he goes over 21.
If he selects Fold he will drop out of that hand.
